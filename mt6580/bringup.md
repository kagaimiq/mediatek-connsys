# How to bringup CONNSYS on MT6580

**No effort**

idk how to do that but there is [this](codes/watashi.py)

basically you have to power up some regulators esp. if you have the MT6350 PMIC *Based* system

then you have other stuff to do like power up the MtC_Mos of the CoNsys,
then write something into some addRess and now you are good to go ....

if yo think this is nonsense then you'r right !!

To power down do all of that in referse
